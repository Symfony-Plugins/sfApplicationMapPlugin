sfApplicationMapPlugin
========================

Provides you with a task generating images of appliaction-module-action
structure of the project using the graphviz tool.

Installation
============

Install the plugin via the subversion repository by executing the following
command from the project root directory:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfApplicationMapPlugin/branches/1.4 plugins/sfApplicationMapPlugin

or by using the default symfony plugin install command:

    $ ./symfony plugin:install sfApplicationMapPlugin

Usage
=====

After you have created your applications, modules and actions, simply type the
following command:

    $ ./symfony project:application-map

which creates the _doc/graph_ directory and few files inside it:

  *   __application-map.dot__ - source graphviz file for all image files

and alternative images of application map:

  *   __application-map.dot.png__ : image created by __dot__ command
  *   __application-map.neato.png__ : image created by __neato__ command
  *   __application-map.twopi.png__ : image created by __twopi__ command
  *   __application-map.circo.png__ : image created by __circo__ command
  *   __application-map.fdp.png__ : image created by __fdp__ command

All possible GraphViz modes are used so that you can just choose which image is
the most readable for you.

Configuration
=============

All visual settings of the images can be set in the __config/map.ini__ file of
the plugin. Example settings look like the following:

    app_shape           = doublecircle
    app_style           = filled
    app_fillcolor       = goldenrod2

You can find all properties properly interpreted by GraphViz in its
documentation, such as [colors](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/colors.html) or
[shapes](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html).

Important notes
===============

  * All actions in _actions.class.php_ or _components.class.php_ must be
    documented for the plugin to parse them. Use the default action skeleton
    documentation block provided with symfony.
