sfApplicationMapPlugin
========================

Provides you with a task generating images of appliaction-module-action
structure of the project using the graphviz tool.

Installation
============

Install the plugin via the subversion repository:

    $ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfApplicationMapPlugin/trunk plugins/sfApplicationMapPlugin

from the project root directory or by using the command:

    $ ./symfony plugin:install sfApplicationMapPlugin

Usage
=====

After you have created your applications, modules and actions () Simply type the following command:

    $ ./symfony project:application-map

which creates few files under the _doc/graph_ directory:

  *   __application-map.dot__ - source graphviz file for all image files

and alternative images of application map:

  *   __application-map.dot.png__ : image created by __dot__ command
  *   __application-map.neato.png__ : image created by __neato__ command
  *   __application-map.twopi.png__ : image created by __twopi__ command
  *   __application-map.circo.png__ : image created by __circo__ command
  *   __application-map.fdp.png__ : image created by __fdp__ command

All possible GraphViz modes are used so that you can just choose which image is
the most readable for you.

Important notes
===============

  * All actions in _actions.class.php_ must be documented for the plugin to
    parse them. Use the default action skeleton documentation block provided
    with symfony.
